# Bayes-Law-Maths-Fair

This is a submission for Saraswathi Vidyalaya's Maths fair 2021. When it comes to disease test results, an accurate test may not always mean a predictive test. Often, the actual chances of disease even while a test returns a positive result is not the most intuitive. 

The objective of this project is a create a population class with cofigurable characteristics to model the validity of the test in each scenario.

Population attributes:
-size
  Size of the population. type: int
-prevelance
  prevalance of disease. type: float
-accuracy
  accuracy of test. type: float
